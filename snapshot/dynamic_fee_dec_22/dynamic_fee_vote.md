# Dynamic Fee Mechanism for Moonbeam's networks

This is a proposal to overhaul Moonbeam’s fee mechanism to adopt an algorithmic, congestion-based fee multiplier in the same spirit as EIP-1559.  
Instead of adopting the exact EIP-1559 algorithm, we use pallet-transaction-payment’s algorithm and translate it to an equivalent EIP-1559 base-fee for Ethereum transactions while carefully tuning the algorithm’s parameters to ensure that it remains feasible for all meaningful transactions.

**How much potential value would this feature bring to Moonbeam/Moonriver?**

# Remote EVM execution for Moonriver and Moonbeam

This is a poll to get the community sentiment on a feature to allow Remote EVM execution for Moonriver and Moonbeam.

The main goal is to install the EthereumXcm pallet in Moonriver and Moonbeam, which acts as a proxy between the XCM execution and the EVM world.

A link to the full discussion in the Moonbeam Community Forum can be found below.

Assuming the overall sentiment is positive, a future on-chain governance proposals will be up for official community vote including this feature.

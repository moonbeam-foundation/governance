This is a poll to get the community sentiment on opening HRMP channel between Moonbeam and Centrifuge, and the draft proposal and discussion are posted below:  
[https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/t/discussion-about-open-hrmp-channel-between-moonbeam-and-centrifuge/719/1](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/t/discussion-about-open-hrmp-channel-between-moonbeam-and-centrifuge/719/1)

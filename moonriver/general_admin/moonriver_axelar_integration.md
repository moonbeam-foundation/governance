# Moonriver <> Axelar Integration 
**TLDR;**

* Moonriver community members have voiced their concerns regarding the lack of a major bridging/GMP protocol being available on Moonriver
* The Moonbeam Foundation has held discussions with various GMP protocol teams, including Axelar
* The Axelar Amplifier Pilot Program represents a unique opportunity for Moonriver to be integrated with Axelar’s next generation architecture
* The costs are not insignificant (~ $400K) and it is proposed that funding for the pilot program and operating costs come from the Moonriver Parachain Bond Reserve which currently holds > 390K MOVR (~ $9M)
* The decision to fund and participate in the program is up to the Community, and this post aims to present the opportunity for community feedback

**Disclaimer**

The Moonbeam Foundation is presenting this opportunity for the community to consider and to decide if pursuing this solution is in the best interest of the ecosystem. As with any GMP/Bridging protocol, there are inherent risks. This post should not be construed as an endorsement by the Moonbeam Foundation.

**Background**

For the past several months, there’s been feedback from various Moonriver community members that they would really like to see a new GMP (General Message Passing) protocol partner deployed to Moonriver. In discussions with various community members, this was seen as a positive step for the ecosystem, allowing liquidity to be bridged both in and out to other ecosystems such as Ethereum mainnet, Cosmos, etc.

Having heard this feedback, the Moonbeam Foundation has engaged with various teams to gauge their interest in deploying to Moonriver while at the same time trying to understand what kind of support (financial or otherwise) may be needed to make it happen. As with any robust GMP solution, infrastructure must be deployed with appropriate incentive structures in place.

In speaking with the team from Axelar, there is an opportunity for Moonriver to join the Axelar Amplifier Pilot Program. This program seeks to accelerate the transition to a new, more scalable architecture with the goal of connecting thousands of chains.

**Summary of Amplifier Pilot Program**

Axelar has successfully connected dozens of ecosystems over the past few years and has established itself as a tier-one GMP protocol in the industry.

As more chains are onboarded, changes are needed to solve problems related to scale and complexity. To address this, Axelar is launching Interchain Amplifier – a permissionless model and service that allows anyone to easily and seamlessly create a connection to the Axelar network and all of its interconnected chains powered by the Axelar Virtual Machine.

Axelar is accepting 3 to 5 teams (of which Moonriver would be one) to join a private pilot program beginning in January 2024 with the goal of achieving mainnet launch of Amplifier in Q2.

Participating teams will allocate dedicated engineers that will be responsible for leading the technical development and provide critical feedback during the testing phase through to launch.

The Axelar DevRel and Engineering teams will provide white-glove support to participants, ensuring participant teams are familiar with the Axelar architecture & the components that need to be developed/deployed to successfully connect to the network.

Participation in the program will significantly reduce the amount of time to integrate a chain to the Axelar network. Non-participating teams will still receive support via public channels and monthly calls but will no doubt take longer to integrate.

More details regarding the new Amplifier architecture can be found on the Axelar Community Forum in [this post](https://community.axelar.network/t/adjusting-axelar-network-incentives-a-proposal-to-scale-to-thousands-of-chains-call-for-comments/2515)

**Forecasted Costs**

It is estimated that the first year cost of this initiative will be approximately ~400K USD which covers participation in the Amplifier Pilot Program, Validator Incentives and Relayer services.

This is only an estimate - some costs will become clearer after launch but this should provide the community with a ballpark figure.

**Proposed Source of Funding**

In order to fund participation in the program and the infrastructure costs for operation, it is proposed to draw upon Moonriver’s parachain bond reserve.

The parachain bond reserve’s purpose is to ensure a parachain slot in perpetuity on Kusama. The current protocol tokenomics are such that the parachain bond reserve is funded via a portion of inflation. Its allocation at genesis was 50,000 MOVR but [it now holds more than 390,000 MOVR](https://moonriver.subscan.io/account/0x5a04d242669edf087ab5e6829b10d9556f4020a3). Moreover, the Moonbeam Foundation has accumulated a significant amount of KSM to support Moonriver’s parachain slot for some time. (Until Polkadot 2.0 fee markets are introduced, it is difficult to say for how long).

As discussed in [this forum post](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/time-for-adjustments-tokenomics-inflation/1389/31?u=aaron.mbf), the Moonbeam Foundation has begun a study to assess network operational costs and the tokenomics of the protocol to ensure long term sustainability of the Moonbeam networks. In an ideal world, this study would be completed, and used as a reference, before committing to reallocating a portion of the parachain bond reserve. However, given current market dynamics, the community may feel that acting now is in the best interest of the ecosystem.

**Next Steps**

The intent of this post is to present this opportunity to the Moonriver community to solicit feedback.

After community members have had a chance to voice their opinion, ask questions and provide feedback, and if there is enough interest and support, the next step would be to hold a referendum on Moonriver as to whether this opportunity should be pursued and funded as described above.

As the Amplifier program is beginning shortly, the hope is to collect feedback and respond to questions until January 21, 2024 before putting it to a community vote.

Three teams submitted proposals, and after a thorough evaluation, the [Beamswap](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/beamswap-s-moonriver-ecosystem-grant-draft-proposal/1697) team was selected to receive funding. This proposal requests 96,909 MOVR from the Parachain Bond Reserve to fund:
-   Beamswap’s V3 AMM Development: 10,025 MOVR    
-   Liquidity in Beamswap’s AMM: 43,442 MOVR

The Beamswap funding will be released in stages, tied to key project milestones. Approval from the Moonriver community is requested to proceed.

## Context  
In April 2024, a call was made for community input to shape Moonriver's DeFi strategy. The primary goals were to determine the level of community support and gather feedback on using the Moonriver Parachain Bond Reserve for this purpose. Additionally, the post aimed to identify project teams within the ecosystem interested in seeking grant funding for this initiative.

Following the call, three teams submitted proposals. The current Grants Committee was assigned the task of evaluating these proposals. This comprehensive evaluation process involved:
-   thorough reviews of each proposal;    
-   follow-up questions and constructive suggestions for improvement to each team;
-   internal discussions and a voting process to determine the final recipient.

After a meticulous review and voting process, the Beamswap team was selected as the grant recipient.

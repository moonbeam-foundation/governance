# Standardize XCM/HRMP Channel Opening Proposals and Disclosures 
## TL:DR 
Let's make key information more accessible to Moonbeam community 
members when voting on XCM/HRMP Channel Openings and when using the 
[Moonbeam Dapp](https://apps.moonbeam.network).
## Summary
XCM enables cross-chain collaboration between parachains and is a 
hallmark feature of Polkadot as well as an important aspect of 
Moonbeam's growth. However, with any new tech integration there are 
risks and the Moonbeam community should be more easily able to assess 
these risks when voting on whether to open an HRMP channel (enabling 
XCM) with another parachain. 
To help ensure the community is more informed on XCM/HRMP Channel 
openings, this proposal addresses two items: 
  -  __#1__ A standard template for Proposals to accept/open XCM/HRMP 
channels to/from Moonbeam, including __Required Key Disclosures__ 
  -  __#2__ Suggested enhancement to the [Moonbeam Dapp](https://apps.
moonbeam.network) to link to those Disclosures for assets supported in 
the [Moonbeam Dapp](https://apps.moonbeam.network) 
## XCM Channel Opening Governance Template and Required Key Disclosures
  -  __#1__  A draft of the Proposal must be posted in the [Moonbeam 
[Moonbeam Community Forum](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation) to the community to review, 
ask questions and provide suggestions. The Proposer must submit a draft 
of their Proposal to an *XCM* Category in the Forum and tag *Moonbeam*.
     - While there is no required time the Draft Proposal should be 
available in the Forum before being submitted on-chain, there is 
benefit in gathering community engagement, feedback and support in this 
stage. In addition, community members and forum moderators can 
highlight to the Proposer if required information regarding Disclosures 
is missing allowing the Proposer to amend and refine the Proposal 
before submitting in Governance. 
  -  __#2__ Proposer for a XCM/HRMP Channel Opening must follow a 
standardized XCM/HRMP Channel Opening Proposal Template 
     - i. __Title__: [Network Project Name] Proposal to [Open/ Accept 
HRMP] Channel
     - ii. __Key Disclosures__: *see below the required format and 
content* 
     - iii. __TL:DR__: One sentence summarizing Proposal
     - iv. __Network Information__: One sentence summarizing your 
Network and relevant links to your Network website, Twitter and social 
channels. 
     - v. __Summary__: Brief description of the content of the Proposal
     - vi. __On-Chain Proposal Reference__: Include Moonbeam on-chain 
Proposal # and Hash 
     - vii. __Technical Details__: Provide technical information 
required for community to understand intended purpose of Proposal
     - viii. __Additional Information__: (optional): this last section 
is optional if there is more information the Network thinks would be 
relevant for the community but does not fit into the sections above. 
  -  __#3__ Proposer for a XCM Channel Opening must provide the 
following Key Disclosure as part of the XCM Channel Opening Governance 
Template:
     - i. __Is the Blockchain Code Open-Source (and include Github 
link)?__ *If parts of the code are not open source: please provide 
information on why not*
     - ii. __Is Sudo-disabled on the Network?__ *If Sudo is disabled, 
is the Network controlled by a select group of addresses (<50 
addresses)?*
     - iii. __Have you completed full testing of this integration on 
the Moonbase Alpha TestNet?__
     - iv. __Does your network have a Kusama deployment?__ *If yes, 
please provide Network name and whether your Kusama deployment is 
integrated with Moonriver* 
     - v. __Is your blockchain code audited?__ *If yes, please provide: 
i. the name of Auditors, ii. dates of audit reports and, if available, 
links to audit reports.*
## Suggestion for the Moonbeam Dapp to increase transparency on XCM/ 
HRMP Channels supported in the Dapp. 
The Moonbeam Foundation should consider including a link to the Key 
Disclosures (outlined above) made in the respective networks' XCM/HRMP 
Channel Opening Governance proposals in the [Moonbeam Dapp]
(https://apps.moonbeam.network). It would be helpful to have these 
disclosures available in proximity to any assets supported through that 
network integration. 
Assuming this proposal moves forward and is approved by the community, 
then all future networks that want[Moonbeam Dapp](https://apps.moonbeam.
network) support would have these disclosures laid out the network's XCM
/HRMP Channel Opening Governance proposal. __The only additional ask is 
for the Networks to make a good-faith effort to keep those Key 
Disclosures up to date so long as they are supported by the [Moonbeam 
Dapp](https://apps.moonbeam.network).__  
__For Historical XCM/HRMP Integrations:__ the Moonbeam Foundation 
should consider requiring these Networks to provide the same Key 
Disclosures as outlined above and post in the [Moonbeam Community Forum]
(https://forum.moonbeam.foundation). 
__All Networks must make a good-faith effort to keep those Key 
Disclosures up to date so long as they are supported by the [Moonbeam 
Dapp](https://apps.moonbeam.network).__
